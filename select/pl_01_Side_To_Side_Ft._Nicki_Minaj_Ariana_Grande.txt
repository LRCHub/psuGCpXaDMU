I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy
You've got to be walkin' side to side
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feelin' like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothing
I'm coming at ya
Cuz I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter
Cuz you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothing
These friends, keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them tough cuz I I I I I I I
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy
You've got to be walkin' side to side
(repeat x 2)
Been tryna hide it
Baby what is it gonna hurt
If they don't know
Makin' everybody think we be solo
Just as long as you know you got me
And boy I got ya
Cuz tonight I'm makin' deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me
NICKI RAP:
It's the new style
With the fresh type of flow
Wrist Icicle
Ride dick bicycle
Come through yo
Get you this type of blow
If you wanna Minaj
I got a tricycle
All these bitches flows is my mini me
Body smoking
So they call me young Nicki Chimney
Rappers in they feelings
Cause they feeling me
("murda")

And I got zero chill in me
Kissing me
Copped the blue box that say Tiffany
Curry with the shot
Just tell 'em to call me Stephanie
Gun pop
Then I make my gum pop
I'm the queen of rap
Young Ariana run pop
